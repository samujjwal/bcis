[JScience](http://jscience.org/) - a Java library that does units, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, algebra, and more.  Readable code, well documented, but very complicated.

[jscl-meditor](http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/)  - Much simpler than JScience.  Code is fairly clear but not well documented.  Has a GUI for testing/experimenting.

[JAS (Java Algebra System)](http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/jas/) - Quite complicated, oriented more towards mathematicians.

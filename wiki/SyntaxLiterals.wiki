== Strings ==

Strings are surrounded by double quotation marks.  A double quotation mark may be placed inside a string by using two double quotation marks in a row.  So the string 
{{{
my "friend" Bob
}}}
 could be written 
{{{
"my ""friend"" Bob"
}}}

Strings may contain any character, including line breaks.

C-style string escapes -- `\n`, `\t`, etc -- are not supported.

== Numbers ==

All numbers are stored as arbitrary-precision decimals.  Numbers may be written as integers or with C-style floating point syntax.  The following numbers are all identical:
{{{
42
42e1
42.
42.0
42.0e1
42.00000000000000000000
}}}

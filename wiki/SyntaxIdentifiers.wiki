= Identifiers =

There are 2 kinds of identifiers.  Both are case-sensitive.

*Global* identifiers are used for functions, constants, units, and measures.  Global identifiers must begin with a letter and may contain letters, numbers, and underscores.  Global identifiers may not use the same name as any built-in keywords.

*Local* identifiers are used for variable names in functions.  Local identifiers begin with '$' followed by a letter.  They may contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

A local identifier's name (without the '$') may be the same as a global identifier, so a local variable named "$meter" will not clash with a unit named "meter".

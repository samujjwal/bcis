[http://jscience.org/ JScience] - a Java library that does units, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, algebra, and more.  Readable code, well documented, but very complicated.

[http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/ jscl-meditor]  - Much simpler than JScience.  Code is fairly clear but not well documented.  Has a GUI for testing/experimenting.

= Concepts to Research =

== Significant Digits & Decimal Arithmetic ==

We need to understand significant digits / significant figures.  We need a list of rules for how they work to make sure we implement it correctly.

we need to know how to do decimal-accurate arithmetic with significant digits.

== Symbolic Algebra ==

We need to know how to do simple symbolic algebra with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.


== Inferred Calculations ==

We need to know how to figure out how to automatically calculate something given a set of known values and algebraic relationships.  Maybe this is as simple as a shortest-path search through a graph of relationships, or maybe it requires some logic programming.

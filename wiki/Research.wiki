= Concepts to Research =

== Physics & Chemistry ==

http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~probs/ - basic to advanced physics problems with solutions

== Computer Algebra in Java ==

[http://jscience.org/ JScience] - a Java library that does units, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, algebra, and more.  Readable code, well documented, but very complicated.

[http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/ jscl-meditor]  Much simpler than JScience.  Code is fairly clear but not well documented.  Has a GUI for testing/experimenting.

[http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/jas/ JAS (Java Algebra System)] - Quite complicated, oriented more towards mathematicians.
